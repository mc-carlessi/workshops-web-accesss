# Introduction

## About this Workshop

One of the features of MySQL is to create stored routines to make automation and better security.
MySQL 9 extend from SQL to javascript the development language for these, a language well know by developers, fast, rich  and performant. 

In this workshop we focus on stored procedures and stored functions, starting with an overview of generic sql, to move then to javascript.
We'll play with  SQL, and javascript and see how to create stored procedures and functions to improve our MySQL instances.
This is not an SQL or javascript course, and basic knowledge of MYSQL, SQL and javascript is recommended.

This workshop is created for a specific Innovation release (***MySQL Server 9.2***).  
It may not works in some parts for other Innovation releases.
